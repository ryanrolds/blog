The first post of a new blog. After a few weeks working part-time on Pedantic Orderliness, I'm finally to the point of writing actual content.

Welcome. At this site, you will find my thoughts, opinions, and learnings regarding software development, video & board games, hiking/backpacking, telecommuting, and professional development. 

I'm a Lead Software Engineer at a design software company. I mostly work in Go, Node.js, Python, and C++. I've worked as a developer at a few startups, a mid-sized company, contracted on a couple web applications, and done a little phone technical support. These days, I telecommute and have a strong preference for it and having a private office.

I spread my professional development time across a few personal projects:

  * <a href="https://github.com/ryanrolds/picar">Picar</a> - A cat chasing robot made with a Raspberry Pi, Tensorflow, and small robotic car platform. 
  * <a href="https://github.com/ryanrolds/pedantic_orderliness">Pedantic Orderliness</a> - This blog. It's made with Go, Markdown, and AWS ECS.
  * <a href="https://github.com/ryanrolds/polyglot_book">Project Polyglot</a> - A set of articles covering concepts critical to working on software, regardless of language and application type.

The remainder of my time goes to my amazing wife, Kali, and two cats, Ockham and Moxi. Kali and I spend our time hiking, backpacking, going to the coast, eating at nice restaurants, and traveling around the Pacific Northwest. I'm also slowly learning to play the saxophone.

I hope you enjoy the site and find the content useful.

  <p>I'm Ryan Olds, a Software Engineer telecommuting from Eugene, OR. I spend most of my time working on highly
    available software applications, gaming (board & video), learning saxophone, hiking &amp; backpacking,
    and living life with an awesome wife &amp; cats.</p>
  <p>As this blog grows it will become an assortment of posts about personal projects, 
    things I've found noteworthy, reviews of games, and random musings.</p>
